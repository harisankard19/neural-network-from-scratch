# neural-network-from-scratch

Coding a neural network from scratch is valuable for building a deep, practical understanding of how core concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent actually work. It removes reliance on high-level libraries, forces you to think critically about each component, and improves debugging and problem-solving skills. While it's not efficient for real-world deployment, doing it is essential for solidifying foundational knowledge in machine learning.
